# Weather App
A simple web app that displays local weather variables based on search.

## Initial setup
- Clone the repo
- run `npm install` (instructions for installing npm can be found [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm) if you dont already have it)

## Running the app
After following the initial setup steps, a simple `npm run dev` from root will run it on localhost. Click the link in your terminal & try it out!

This is my first real run at building an app from scratch based off of my own ideas. I asked friends and family what they'd like to see 
from a weather app and I ran with it! Plans to build a mobile version and improve existing functionality are in the works.
